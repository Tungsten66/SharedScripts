.SYNOPSIS
    Convert 2019 App control policy to support Server 2016
.DESCRIPTION
    This script converts a Server 2019 App Control policy XML file to a format compatible with Server 2016.
    It removes unsupported rules, updates the policy name and ID, and creates a binary policy file.
    
    The script prompts the user to select the Server 2019 XML policy file and the folder to save the converted Server 2016 policy.
    It then modifies the XML file accordingly and generates a .p7b binary file.
.INPUTS
    None. The script prompts the user to select the input XML file and output folder.
.OUTPUTS
    A converted Server 2016 App Control policy XML file and a .p7b binary file.
