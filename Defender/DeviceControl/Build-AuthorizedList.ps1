.SYNOPSIS
   Build an XML file from a CSV file containing USB device InstancePathId values.
.DESCRIPTION
   This script reads a CSV file containing USB device InstancePathId values and builds an XML file with these values.
   The script replaces the last digit in each InstancePathId with a wildcard (*) to account for variable USB slot numbers.
   It also escapes the '&' character in the InstancePathId values to ensure valid XML formatting.
.INPUTS
    The script takes a CSV file as input, which should contain a column named 'InstancePathId'.
    The CSV file is expected to be located at "C:\Temp\AuthorizedUSBs.csv".
    The XML file is expected to be located at "C:\Temp\AuthorizedUSBs.xml".
    The script will overwrite the existing XML file with the new data.
.OUTPUTS
   The script outputs the updated XML file to "C:\Temp\AuthorizedUSBs.xml".
   The XML file will contain a root element with a child element "DescriptorIdList", which contains multiple "InstancePathId" elements.
