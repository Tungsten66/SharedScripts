.SYNOPSIS
     Create or update tags for AWS Arc-enabled machines in Azure Arc.
.DESCRIPTION
    By default, AWS Arc-enabled machines in Azure Arc are named using their AWS instance ID, which may not be intuitive for users.
    Refer to: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-arc/servers/azcmagent-connect
    This script improves identification by tagging each AWS Arc-enabled machine with its computer name.
    It scans for AWS Arc-enabled machines, checks if the "ComputerName" tag matches the OSProfile.ComputerName property, and applies the tag if needed.
    Machines already tagged with the correct value are skipped.
    Requires the Az.ConnectedMachine and Az.Resources PowerShell modules.
    Minimum permissions required: Microsoft.HybridCompute/machines/read, Microsoft.Resources/tags/write.
.INPUTS
    -CloudEnvironment
.OUTPUTS
    Tags applied to AWS Arc-enabled machines.
